### Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data Project Submission

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The raw data and the description of the files used can be [found here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Requirements

The requirements of this project are to write a script (run_analysis.R) that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
